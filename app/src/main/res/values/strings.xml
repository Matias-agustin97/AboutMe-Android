    <string name="bio">I like you a lot, but you dont seem to like me that much. i often think that you hate, and begin to think ways i have offended you in the past \n
    . At the same time, i cant seem to forgive you for about what you did almost 4 years ago. that wound never heal.i tried to heal but you always find me right when i
        was about to forget you.
        its like you cant let me go out of pure egoism, after all this time you still want me as a backup.
        You just want to use me when you need to, you dont care about, you dont care how i feel. everytime is the same.
        The moment i completed my purpuse you throw me away, like a tissue.\n
        Then when you need me again, you come back as if nothing ever happened.\n
        I should start to recocnize these patters, i often do them while dating adela..\
        am a piece of shit.
        ON OTHER NOTE, USE lineSpacingMultipler para aumentar el espacio entre renglones,
        haciendo todo mas facil de leer.\n
        Maybe in a months time, or even better, when new ryzen or intel chips arrive, i ll be a experienced kotlin developer \n
